# NotesApp

This is a project for my Advanced Object Oriented Programming course. 

**_Important:_ If you want to run the application, make sure to run it from a windows command prompt or powershell**

The users of the app can store their notes and checklists in folders where they are able to manipulate them by various actions. They also have a trash where they can temporarily move the notes before deleting them permanently. The unique aspect of the app is represented by the PROTECTED notes/checklist. They are special types of notes/checklists that you are required to set a password for and you will be asked to enter the password each time you want to work with those items. Another interesting feature is that notes/checklists can also be imported/exported from/to files.

The app is meant to keep track of user accounts and their histories (for the moment I don't have a connection to a database, so the accounts only exist during the lifecycle of the process, but this will be solved in the future :)), providing access to a registration/login system. After the login you have full access to your account's content (folders, notes, checklists) and manipulate it the way you like.
